# 🧠 ML Engineer Bootcamp — Project-Based Learning Journey

Welcome to my **12-Week Project-Based Machine Learning Engineer Bootcamp**!  
I'm learning ML the hands-on way — by building real projects, documenting the journey, and sharing my learnings publicly.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Build 8+ ML projects (supervised, unsupervised, deep learning)
- Deploy at least 1 end-to-end ML system
- Document everything on GitHub, LinkedIn, and Medium
